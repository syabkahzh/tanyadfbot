## Memory Update
- `check_fast_path` and `_is_worth_checking` were substantially improved to correctly identify questions (e.g. `aman ga ya`) versus strong signals (`aman spx`).
- Replaced boolean-heavy `_is_worth_checking` with a fast heuristic scoring approach (+ points for strong/promo keywords, - points for questions/noise).
- Both logic sets now enforce filtering on social expressions (like `makasih kak` or `ya allah😭`) lacking actual promotional signals.
- Replaced N+1 SQLite queries for `pending_confirmations` within `main.py`'s bulk loop with batch `executemany` operations to optimize high-volume database inserts and updates.
